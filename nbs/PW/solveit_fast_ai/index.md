# How To Solve It With Code

Ever tried to build something with AI and gotten stuck? **You're not alone.**

The initial results look promising. But then comes the hard part: making changes, adding features, building something real. The truth? AI is an incredible tool for helping us code. But to build real things, you need to understand how they work.

## Hi, I'm Jeremy Howard

I've spent the last 30 years solving problems with code. I made FastMail, a major email provider used by millions (where I wrote everything from spam filters to virus scanners), built tools that automated insurance pricing, and created systems for the world's biggest coding competitions. Through fast.ai (part of Answer.ai), I've taught hundreds of thousands of students who've gone on to work at companies like Google, Apple, and Tesla.

Now, I'm excited to bring you the first new fast.ai course in years. After teaching so many people to use AI, we've discovered something important: there's a completely new way to combine AI with coding, and we want to share it with you. For details about the new course curriculum, see the course details page.

# What Makes This Different

We start solving concrete problems on day one. No waiting weeks to learn theory - you'll dive right in and build something useful. Our approach breaks complex challenges into small, solvable pieces that you can understand completely.

  * **Iterative Development:** learn the same step-by-step process used by experienced programmers, but rarely taught.
  * **Master Your Code:** understand everything you build, no more hitting walls when you need to make changes.

# Is this course for me?

### Ideal Student

  * You've tried using AI tools (or you'd like to), such as ChatGPT for coding 
  * You're ready to understand your code, not just copy-paste 
  * You want to build enduring things, not just experiment 
  * You're prepared to work with us through this initial beta version of the course 

## Course Details

Join us live to solve real problems. First, we show you how. Then you try it yourself. We guide you through each step so you know exactly what you're doing. We'll meet twice a week for 8 weeks, with a break for the holidays:

* * *

  * Lessons 1 - 3

Nov. 26th - Dec 15th

  * Break

  * Lessons 4 - 8

Jan 7th - Feb 6th

  

The lessons will be recorded, so you can watch them anytime - and not worry about missing that Thanksgiving dinner

If you want to know more about the course and our mission to democratize artificial intelligence, read the blog post announcing the course.

## Limited Availability

Seats are limited, so we encourage everyone to sign up as soon as possible. Additionally, we have a hard cutoff date of November 24th where no additional signups will be accepted.

## Support

You'll learn from experts Jeremy Howard and Johno Whitaker, with help from Audrey Roy Greenfeld and our fast.ai team. You'll also join a community of builders who support each other.

It's all a bit of an experiment, which is why we've made it so cheap for this first version.
